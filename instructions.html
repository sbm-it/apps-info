      <h3 style="color:maroon">About</h3>
      <p style="color:navy">As part of a new "mobile-first" technology development initiative, <a href="http://stonybrookmedicine.edu/" target="_blank">Stony Brook Medicine</a> is developing an App Store.</p>
      <p style="color:navy">We seek to assess the cross-platform use of HTML5 Apps, very much along the same lines of <a href="http://smarthealthit.org/smart-on-fhir/" target="_blank">SMART</a>. Similarly, this is also an effort to make the most of patient-facing informatics applications using the new <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/summary.html" target="_blank">HL7 FHIR</a>.
      <p style="color:navy">The <i><b>sbmApps</b></i> framework makes use of another technological innovation, this time in Web Technologies: the emergence of WebApp standards supported by Web Browser manufacturers, as described by <a href="http://www.w3.org/2008/webapps/" target="_blank">W3C\'s WebApps Working Group</a>. This mechanism uses the "add to home screen" feature in your browser to assemble a native-looking App if a properly formated manifest is found (which sbmApps includes already). The same application will also be ported to the App stores of Chrome, Android, Apple and Microsoft.</p>
